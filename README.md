Project Overview**

**1. Task_1 project: Sales Data Analysis**

This repository contains the work for the Brainwave_Matrix_Intern project, focusing on sales data analysis and visualization. The main task was to analyze sales data and generate insights using Python and various data analysis libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

Features
Total sales analysis per month
Sales data visualization using bar charts
City-wise sales analysis
Hourly sales trends
Dataset
The dataset used for this project consists of sales data with the following columns:

Order ID: Unique identifier for each order
Product: The product name
Quantity Ordered: The number of units sold
Price Each: The price per unit
Order Date: The date and time of the order
Purchase Address: The shipping address
Month: Extracted from the order date
Sales: Calculated by multiplying the quantity ordered by the price each
City: The city to which the product was shipped
Hour: The hour of the day the order was placed
Technology Stack
Programming Language: Python
Libraries Used:
Pandas (Data manipulation)
Matplotlib (Data visualization)
Seaborn (Advanced visualizations)

Results
Monthly Sales: A bar chart visualizing total sales for each month.
City-Wise Sales: A visualization showing the total sales per city.
Hourly Sales: Insights on the time of day when sales are highest.



**2. Task _2 Project: Social Media Sentiment Analysis**

In this project, It is conducted that a comprehensive Social Media Sentiment Analysis using the Sentiment140 dataset, aimed at understanding public sentiment toward various topics. Through a systematic approach, I performed the following steps:

Data Collection: Successfully downloaded and extracted the dataset, ensuring access to valuable social media data.

Data Preprocessing: Utilized natural language processing (NLP) techniques to clean and tokenize the text data, enhancing its quality for analysis.

Sentiment Analysis: Implemented a sentiment analysis algorithm to classify tweets into positive, neutral, and negative sentiments, extracting sentiment scores to quantify public opinion.

Data Visualization: Employed visualizations to depict sentiment distribution and trends over time, providing insights into the fluctuations of public sentiment related to specific topics or events.

This analysis not only highlights the power of NLP in extracting meaningful insights from unstructured text data but also demonstrates the capability to visualize and interpret sentiments in a clear and impactful manner. The findings from this project can serve as a foundation for further research or applications in social media analytics, marketing strategies, and public opinion monitoring.

Future Work: Moving forward, additional analyses could include exploring the relationships between sentiment and specific keywords, applying machine learning models for sentiment classification, or expanding the dataset to include more diverse sources of social media data.

This project has successfully achieved its objectives, showcasing the potential of data science and analytics in understanding and interpreting public sentiment through social media platforms.
